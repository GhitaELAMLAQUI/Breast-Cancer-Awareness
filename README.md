## CONTEXT :

Breast cancer is **the most common type of cancer in the world**. Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer.
About 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected at an early stage.
For this reason, **it's vital that women check their breasts regularly** for any changes and always have any changes examined by a GP.

## WHAT IS THE WEBSITE ABOUT ?

Breast cancer can have several symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. So this website helps to increase attention to this matter, and to raise people's awareness.
